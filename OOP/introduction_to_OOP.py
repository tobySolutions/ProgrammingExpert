Notes:

- Object Oriented Programming is a style of programming

- Data types are defined by classes in Python.

- A "Method" is a function that acts on an instance of a class (on an object)

- An "object" is an instance of a class. It has access to the methods defined in the class and it obeys the rules of the class.

- Data types are classes.

- A "class" is a template or blueprint for the creation of objects.

- An object's type is defined by the class that was used to instantiate it.
